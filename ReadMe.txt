# DevCard_Project - From Atria Asp.net Course 
-------------------------------------------------

✅ in this small project that is based on mvc i tried to 
    use most of the Features that asp.net provide for us
    this course clearly mentioned every step and with 
    help of this course till now i developed these steps

-------------------------------------------------

🔷 Explanation of every Step for Clean Code :

   1 - It uses partialView for rending pages in separate parts
       and it helps to have a more clear understaing of views.

   2 - It uses ViewComponents , wtih this feature we can separate
       every part our view for example index page , every part is in
       different Component , so we can handel it easier also give us
       more control like handing data.

   3 - Done form validation for both frontend and bacnend 

   4 - and other cases that you can check out inside app

-------------------------------------------------

🔶 feel free to test it
